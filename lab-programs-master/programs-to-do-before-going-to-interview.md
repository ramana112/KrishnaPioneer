1. The program has to find the longest increasing sequence of consecutive elements. So if the user enters "3,2,1,2,4,6,7,8,1,2" the program will output "1,2,4,6,7,8".

2. Write a program that simulates a dice roll by picking a random number from 1-6 and then picking a second random number from 1-6. Add the two values together, and display the total. 
Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 3
The total is 5

3. to convert my java program that takes input from the user in the form of roman numerals and converts it to integers and then prints it out. 
Roman Numerals:  "I V X L"
Decimal values:   1, 5, 10, 50

4. There are a limited number of players and a limited number of tennis courts. At each round, there can be at most as many matches as there are courts. Nobody plays 2 rounds without a break. Everyone plays a match against everyone else. Produce the schedule that takes as few rounds as possible. (Because of the rule that there must a break between rounds for everyone, there can be a round without matches.) The output for 5 players and 2 courts could be:

|   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|-----|
|  1 |  1 | -  |   |   | |
|  2 |  5 |  3 | -  |   | |
|  3 |  7 |  9 |  1 | - | |
|  4 |  3 |  7 |  9 | 5  | -|

In this output the columns and rows are the player-numbers, and the numbers inside the matrix are the round numbers these two players compete.
